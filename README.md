## ðŸ“¥ Dataset Setup
This project uses the **Seoul Bike Sharing Demand** dataset, originally provided via Kaggle:
- [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/seoul-bike-sharing-demand-prediction)

### 1. Configure Kaggle API Credentials
To enable CLI-based dataset downloads:
1. Go to [Kaggle Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account)
2. Scroll to **API** and click **"Create New API Token"**
3. Move the downloaded `kaggle.json` file to your `.kaggle` directory:
```bash
mkdir ~/.kaggle
mv ~/Downloads/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```
### 2. Dataset Download
To download the dataset, use:
```bash
 kaggle datasets download -d saurabhshahane/seoul-bike-sharing-demand-prediction -p data/raw --unzip
```
